New features:

- Proxies now parse two kinds of special URLs:
  - mydoc/downloadFile/attrname/mydocname.pdf to download a file
    This makes it possible to have URLs ending with the file name
  - mydoc/archivedRevision/n/... to access archived revisions
    An archived revision is a non-persistent proxy child of the active
    proxy. It doesn't have any workflow state.
