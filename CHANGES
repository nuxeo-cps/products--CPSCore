Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- The index localUsersWithRoles (type KeywordIndex) would be added by
  CPSDefault's cpsupdate if not done manually.
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- You can delete local roles for given member ids at the bottom of the
  Configuration tab in portal_membership. Use with care, remember the Undo tab
  ;-)
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Now the 'homeless' attribute of a member is taken into account through a
  direct query to the members directory.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new method to IndexableObjectWrapper: localUsersWithRoles, which returns
  users having a role on the object _but_ without any merge.
- deleting an account will not delete local roles assigned to this user 
  in the datafs, for now this is too costly and not done by default,
  a zmi management screen to prune invalid local roles is planned.
- More complete makeId and use it instead of redefining one.
