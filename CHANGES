Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- The index localUsersWithRoles (type KeywordIndex) would be added by
  CPSDefault's cpsupdate if not done manually.
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Now the 'homeless' attribute of a member is taken into account through a
  direct query to the members directory.
- XXX reopen #319: Roles locally assigned not deleted with the user account
  by the time of a better implementation.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new method to IndexableObjectWrapper: localUsersWithRoles, which returns
  users having a role on the object _but_ without any merge.
- Use this new index to delete all roles of given users when deleting their
  account (finally closes #319 I hope).
