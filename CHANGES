- #1731: Error editing files with external editor
- added the proxy optional arg to the 'document.edit' call of the PUT method of
  the FileDownloader class
- disabling MA's Zipping workaround for old buggy OO 1.1 / IE plugin that was
  unable to open sxw/sxc files under authenticated sessions. Recent (2.0.x)
  versions of the pluging now works correctly, thus we can directly download and
  open those kind of files.
