Miscellaneous notes.

Standard Behavior
=================

``user:me`` belongs to ``group:secretary``

::

    allowedRolesAndUsers: (stored in catalog index)
     ['Reviewer', 'Manager',    # (roles having permission View in security map)
      'user:toto', 'user:riri', # (users having those roles as local roles)
      'group:secretary',        # (groups having those roles as local roles)
     ]

(describes who has View permission on the object.)

The catalog query is done with our identities::

    allowedRolesAndUsers=['Reviewer',        # current *global* user roles
                          'Anonymous',       # always present
                          'user:me',         # current user
                          'group:secretary', # current user's groups
                         ]

Will match because of group:secretary and also Reviewer.

Why do we keep user roles? In what case could we have a Reviewer
role allowed but not our 'user:me' (or one of our groups)? Only if
the allowedRolesAndUsers index has 'Reviewer' and not 'user:me'.
Which means that during indexing, 'user:me' didn't have the
Reviewer roles, but now has it. That's not possible with local
roles (because when local roles change, we re-index
allowedRolesAndUsers) so it must come from a global role.

Blocking syntax
===============

The blocking syntax for a role is a prefix of '-' for that role. For
instance, giving the role '-Reviewer' for 'group:role:Anonymous' blocks
everyone from having the role 'Reviewer'. The role '-' blocks
everything.

For local role blocking to be effective and use existing catalog
datastructures, we can't block arbitrarily. The only case we keep is to
block everybody for a given role, and not block individual users or
groups. "Everybody" is formalized as 'group:role:Anonymous'.

Because nobody or everybody is blocked for a given role, the
allowedRolesAndUsers datastructure can still be computed.
