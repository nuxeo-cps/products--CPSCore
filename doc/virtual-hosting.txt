Virtual Hosting
===============

This document explains how to deal with inside-out virtual hosting when
building urls to objects, including breadcrumbs urls.

Related tickets:
- http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/ticket/436: "getBaseUrl.py doesn't work as
  expected behind Apache virtual hosts"
- http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/ticket/654: "Subsites and virtual hosting"

These tickets are fixed by using proper methods (portal_url methods) to
get proper paths (relative or not) to objects.

Still, some issues need to be fixed:

  virtual hosting"

General case of virtual hosting
===============================

The most complex case need of virtual hosting is the case where part of
the portal is hidden in the URL, and part of the URL is completely virtual:
- virtual url: http://www.site.com/foo/bar/my-folder/my-file
- zope absolute path: /cps/workspaces/my-folder/my-file

This can be achieved with a rewrite rule like::

  RewriteRule ^/foo/bar(.*)$ http://localhost:20000/VirtualHostBase/http/%{SERVER_NAME}:80/cps/workspaces/VirtualHostRoot/_vh_foo/_vh_bar/$1 [L,P]

Fundamental concepts
====================

The fundamental concepts manipulated inside CPS are:
- object's physical path: ('', 'cps', 'workspaces', 'my-folder', 'my-file')
- same as a string: '/cps/workspaces/my-folder/my-file'
- object's rpath: 'workspaces/my-folder/my-file'
- object's URL: http://www.site.com/foo/bar/my-folder/my-file

The rpath is the zope path relative to the portal. It's called
"relativeContentURL" by CMF, but this is wrong as it's not an URL.

An object's URL is only ever used on output, it's not used for internal
treatments.

Public methods
==============

The only public methods to be used by user code are:
- getRpath(ob): gets an rpath from an object
- ob.absolute_url() or ob.absolute_url_path(): get an URL from an object.
- getUrlFromRpath(rpath): get an URL from an rpath
- portal.restrictedTraverse(rpath): get an object from an rpath

Internals
=========

OFS.Traversable methods:
- absolute_url(self):
  'http://www.site.com/foo/bar/my-folder/my-file'
- absolute_url(self, relative=1):
  'my-folder/my-file'
  This should never be used by user code.
- absolute_url_path(self): '/foo/bar/my-folder/my-file'
  This is a valid URL shortened to not use a site specification.
- virtual_url_path(self): 'my-folder/my-file'
  This should never be used by user code.
- getPhysicalPath(self): ('', 'cps', 'workspaces', 'my-folder', 'my-file'),

CMF URLTool methods:
- getPortalPath(self): '/cps'
- getRelativeContentPath(self, content): ('workspaces', 'my-folder',
  'my-file')
- getRelativeContentURL(self, content) or getRelativeUrl(self, content):
  'workspaces/my-folder/my-file'

CPS URLTool adds new methods:
- getRpath(self, content): alias for getRelativeContentURL(self, content)
  and getRelativeUrl(self, content)
- getBaseUrl(self): /foo/bar/
- getVirtualRootPhysicalPath(self): ('', 'cps', 'workspaces')
  This should never be used by user code (private method)
- getVirtualHostPhysicalPath(self): ('', 'foo', 'bar')
  This should never be used by user code (private method)
- getUrlFromRpath(self, rpath):
  returns 'http://www.site.com/foo/bar/my-folder/my-file' when given
  relative_url 'workspaces/my-folder/my-file'
- getRpathFromPath(self, path): returns 'workspaces/my-folder/my-file' with
  path either ('', 'cps', 'workspaces', 'my-folder', 'my-file') or
  /cps/workspaces/my-folder/my-file. This is useful to get the object rpath
  from the object path in catalog (brain.getPath()).
- getBreadCrumbs(self, context=None, only_parents=0):
  returns parents, omitting objects that are hidden by virtual hosting, and
  with portal as greater parent.
- getBreadCrumbsInfo(self, context=None, only_parents=0, title_size=20):
  returns a list of parents info to be presented in a template. Info is a
  dictionnary with various information (id, title, url...)
